## SC7-Bayes-Methods
Selected teaching material updated durng term. For lecture slides   
and panopto see the [SC7 canvas page](https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/295102).   

I am putting this material here in order to put it outside the canvas firewall.  
It makes it easier to put links in my lecture notes to code.

**Lecture Notes**: folder has lecture notes as they stood in March 2025  
and the latest version of the notes (which will be updated).

**Problem Sheets**: exercises with solutions to selected problems.  
Problem sheets will be added as the term progresses.

**R**: code illustrating some points made in lectures. Not part of the  
taught course but may be useful.
